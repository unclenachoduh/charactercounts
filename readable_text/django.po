About Mozilla Add-ons
What is this website?addons.mozilla.org, commonly known as \"AMO\", is Mozilla's official site for add-ons to Mozilla software, such as Firefox, Thunderbird, and SeaMonkey. Add-ons let you add new features and change the way your browser or application works. Take a look around and explore the thousands of ways to customize the way you do things online.
Who creates these add-ons?The add-ons listed here have been created by thousands of developers from our community, ranging from individual hobbyists to large corporations. All publicly listed add-ons are reviewed by a team of reviewers before being released. Add-ons marked as Experimental have not been reviewed and should only be installed with caution.
How do I keep up with what's happening at AMO?
There are several ways to find out the latest news from the world of add-ons:
Our Add-ons Blog is regularly updated with information for both add-on enthusiasts and developers.
We often post news, tips, and tricks to our Twitter account, mozamo
Our forums are a good place to interact with the add-ons community and discuss upcoming changes to AMO.
This sounds great! How can I get involved?
There are plenty of ways to get involved. If you're on the technical side:
Make your own add-on. We provide free hosting and update services and can help you reach a large audience of users.If you have add-on development experience,  become an Add-on Reviewer! Our reviewers are add-on fans with a technical background who review add-ons for code quality and stability.Help improve this website. It's open source, and you can file bugs and submit patches.  GitHub contains all of our current bugs, legacy bugs can still be found in Bugzilla.
If you're interested in add-ons but not quite as technical, there are still ways to help:
Tell your friends! Let people know which add-ons you use.
Participate in our forums.
Review add-ons on the site. Add-on authors are more likely to improve their add-ons and write new ones when they know people appreciate their work.
I have a question
A good place to start is Support Mozilla. If you don't find an answer there, you can  ask on our forums.
If you really need to contact someone from the Mozilla team, please see our  contact information page.
Who works on this website?
Over the years, many people have contributed to this website, including both volunteers from the community and a dedicated AMO team.

Some tips for writing a great review
Frequently Asked Questions about ReviewsAdd-on reviews are a way for you to share your opinions about the add-ons you’ve installed and used. Our review moderation team reserves the right to refuse or remove any review that does not comply with these guidelines.
Do:
Write like you are telling a friend about your experience with the add-on.
Keep reviews concise and easy to understand.
Give specific and helpful details. For example:
Did the add-on work as you expected it to?
What features did you like or dislike?
Was it useful?
Was it easy to use?
Will you continue to use this add-on?
Take a moment to read your review before submitting it to minimize typos.
Don’t:
Submit one-word reviews such as \"Great!\", \"wonderful,\" or \"bad.\"Post technical issues, support requests, or feature suggestions. Use the available support options for each add-on, if available. You can find them in the side column next to the About this Add-on section.
Write reviews for add-ons which you have not personally used.
Use profanity, sexual language or language that can be construed as hateful.
Include HTML, links, source code or code snippets. Reviews are meant to be text only.
Make false statements, disparage add-on authors or personally insult them.
Include your own or anyone else’s email, phone number, or other personal details.
Post reviews for an add-on you or your organization wrote or represent.Criticize an add-on for something it’s intended to do. For example, leaving a negative review of an add-on for displaying ads or requiring data gathering, when that is the intended purpose of the add-on, or the add-on requires gathering data to function.
How can I report a problematic review?Please report or flag any questionable reviews by clicking the \"Report this review\" and it will be submitted to the site for moderation. Our moderation team will use the Review Guidelines to evaluate whether or not to delete the review or restore it back to the site.
I’m an add-on author, can I respond to reviews?
Yes, add-on authors can provide a single response to a review. You can set up a discussion topic in our forum to engage in additional discussion or follow-up.
I’m an add-on author, can I delete unfavorable reviews or ratings?In general, no. But if the review did not meet the review guidelines outlined above, you can click \"Report this review\" and have it moderated. If a review included a complaint that is no longer valid due to a new release of your add-on, we may consider deleting the review.
Start Now
Mozilla wants to figure out the best way to keep our users safe if they choose to use third-party software such as plugins. Participating in this study will help us find out!
What will happen next
If you agree to participate:
We may add security and plugin control features to Firefox to help with online security and performance.
Continue using Firefox as you normally would. Depending on how you use the Web, you may not notice any changes.
After a few weeks, the study will end on its own. Your Firefox will go back to normal.
We will ask you to fill out a quick optional survey to tell us about your experience. The survey should take less than 5 minutes to complete.
Leaving the study
The study will expire on its own in a few weeks. You may leave the study early. To do so, follow these steps:
Type about:addons into the location bar, and press enter.
Find Plugin Safety in the addons list.
Click the remove button.
If you opt out of the study early we will ask you to fill out a survey. We’re interested in hearing about your experience, even if you didn’t participate in the entire study.
Opting out of a study does not prevent you from participating in future studies.
Your privacy
All Shield Studies
Every Shield Study collects data about important study events, such as install, uninstall, daily usage, and end of study. Studies also include an optional survey.
This data is associated with Firefox Telemetry collection.
This particular Study
In addition to the data collected by all Shield Studies, Mozilla will collect information about:
Websites you visit that try to use plugins, and what content on the site requires the plugin;
How you interact with plugin content on those sites, including whether and how you choose to allow the plugin to run.
Mozilla will keep this information private; any data will only be shared in aggregate or anonymized form.
You can learn more about the data collection for this study here.
You Help Make Firefox BetterAt Mozilla, we pride ourselves on building products for you, the user! That’s why we need your help. By participating in this study, you will help us to make better decisions on your behalf and directly shape the future of Firefox!

About tracking external sources...Tracking external sources  If you link to your add-on's details page or directly to its file from an external site, such as your blog or website, you can append a parameter to be tracked as an additional download source on this page. For example, the following links would appear as sourced by your blog:  Add-on Details Page https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/?src=external-blog Direct File Link https://addons.mozilla.org/downloads/latest//addon--latest.xpi?src=external-blog   Only src parameters that begin with \"external-\" will be tracked, up to 61 additional characters. Any text after \"external-\" can be used to describe the source, such as \"external-blog\", \"external-sidebar\", \"external-campaign225\", etc. The following URL-safe characters are allowed: a-z A-Z - . _ ~ %% +
